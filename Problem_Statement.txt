Customer Problem Context: Our manufacturing operations are experiencing unexpected machine failures, resulting in unplanned downtime, 
reduced production efficiency, and increased maintenance costs. These failures occur with little to no warning, and we do not have 
adequate insights into which machines are at risk of failure. As a result, we are unable to effectively plan for maintenance and prevent
production interruptions, leading to costly operational disruptions and delayed product deliveries.

Goal : The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning-based predictive maintenance model that accurately classifies 
whether a machine will fail or not in advance based on various operational data and sensor readings.
